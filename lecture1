A **normal IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)** is a security system designed to detect and prevent malicious activities or policy violations within a network or system. It works by continuously monitoring network traffic and system activities to identify and block potential threats in real time. Here's a more general explanation of how an IPS works:

### Key Features of a Normal IPS:

1. **Real-Time Traffic Monitoring**:
   - IPS systems inspect network traffic for malicious behavior, typically analyzing packets, traffic flows, and system logs in real time. They can monitor both inbound and outbound traffic for any signs of unauthorized or malicious activity.

2. **Threat Detection**:
   - **Signature-Based Detection**: The IPS compares network traffic against a database of known attack signatures. These signatures represent known attack patterns, such as viruses or exploitation techniques.
   - **Anomaly-Based Detection**: The IPS also monitors network traffic for behavior that deviates from normal patterns. If a device or user behaves abnormally (e.g., accessing sensitive files or performing unexpected actions), the IPS will flag the behavior as suspicious.

3. **Prevention of Attacks**:
   - Once a threat is identified, the IPS will take automated actions to prevent the attack. This might include blocking the malicious traffic, isolating affected systems, or alerting administrators.

4. **Logging and Reporting**:
   - The IPS generates logs of all detected activities, including the nature of the attack, the source and destination, and the actions taken. These logs can be useful for forensic analysis and compliance reporting.

5. **Policy Enforcement**:
   - An IPS can enforce security policies by ensuring that network traffic adheres to a predefined set of rules. For example, it might prevent certain types of traffic (e.g., HTTP on port 80) from entering the network or block access to restricted resources.

6. **Network-Based vs. Host-Based IPS**:
   - **Network-Based IPS (NIPS)**: Typically deployed on network gateways to monitor and protect entire networks by analyzing incoming and outgoing traffic.
   - **Host-Based IPS (HIPS)**: Installed on individual devices or hosts, providing protection for specific machines by monitoring system-level activities, such as file access or application behavior.

7. **Actions Taken by IPS**:
   - **Blocking Traffic**: If a threat is detected, the IPS will block the malicious traffic to prevent further damage.
   - **Alerting**: It generates alerts to notify security administrators of potential attacks.
   - **Traffic Logging**: It records the suspicious traffic for future investigation.

### Types of Attacks Detected by IPS:

- **Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks**: Attempts to overwhelm systems or networks by flooding them with excessive traffic.
- **Buffer Overflows**: Attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in applications by sending more data to a program than it can handle.
- **SQL Injection**: Attacks that inject malicious SQL queries into input fields on websites to manipulate databases.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Malicious scripts injected into web pages viewed by users to steal sensitive information.
- **Malware and Viruses**: Attempts to infect systems with malicious software that can steal data, disrupt operations, or damage systems.

### IPS Deployment:

- **Inline Deployment**: The IPS is placed in the direct path of network traffic, so it can block malicious traffic as soon as it's detected. This is the most common deployment method.
- **Passive (Out-of-Band) Deployment**: The IPS is deployed outside the direct traffic flow, merely monitoring and alerting without actively blocking traffic. This setup is useful for detection and analysis but lacks active prevention.

### Example of How an IPS Works:

1. **Traffic Inspection**: The IPS receives incoming network packets and inspects them to identify any unusual behavior or known attack signatures.
2. **Signature Match**: If the traffic matches a known attack signature, such as a SQL injection attempt, the IPS identifies the attack.
3. **Prevention Action**: The IPS blocks the malicious traffic by rejecting the suspicious packets or isolating the affected device.
4. **Alert Generation**: The IPS sends an alert to the system administrator, detailing the attack and the response actions taken.
5. **Logging**: The IPS logs the event for further analysis and potential investigation.

### Benefits of IPS:

- **Real-Time Protection**: It provides immediate protection by blocking attacks as they occur.
- **Prevention and Detection**: Unlike traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), which only alert on suspicious activity, an IPS can actively prevent malicious actions.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Many organizations need IPS to meet compliance requirements, such as PCI-DSS, HIPAA, or GDPR.
- **Automated Response**: It automates the process of detecting and mitigating threats, reducing the workload on security teams.

### Conclusion:

An **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)** is a critical part of network security, helping to protect against a wide range of attacks and ensuring the integrity and availability of systems and data. Whether deployed in network-based or host-based configurations, it plays a crucial role in defending against modern cyber threats.
